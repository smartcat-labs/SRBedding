       " 1: 'Kao i na većini drugih univerziteta, studenti Notr Dama vode brojne medijske izvore. Devet studenata-upravljaju izlaza uključuju tri novine, i radio i televizijska stanica, i nekoliko časopisa i časopisa. Počeo je kao jednostranični časopis u septembru 1876. godine, časopis Scholastic izdaje se dva puta mesečno i tvrdi da je najstarija kontinuirana kolegijalna publikacija u Sjedinjenim Državama. Druga časopis, The Juggler, objavljuje se dva puta godišnje i fokusira se na studentsku književnost i umetničku radnju. Godišnjik \"Dom\" objavljuje se svake godine. Novine imaju različite publicijske interese, sa The Observer objavljivanjem dnevno i uglavnom izveštavanjem o univerzitetima i drugim vestima, a u osoblje su studenti i iz Notr Dama i koledža Svete Marije. Za razliku od Scholastic i The Dome, The Observer je nezavisna publikacija i nema savetnika fakulteta ili bilo kakvog uredničkog nadzora od Univerziteta. 1987. godine, kada su neki studenti smatrali da je \"Obzerver\" počeo da pokazuje konzervativnu pristrasnost, objavljen je liberalni novinar \"Pojedinski smisao\". Isto tako, 2003. godine, kada su drugi studenti smatrali da je list pokazao liberalni pristrasnost, konzervativni list Irish Rover je počeo da se proizvodi. Ni jedan od ovih papira se ne objavljuje često kao i The Observer; međutim, svi troje se distribuiraju svim studentima. Na kraju, u proleće 2008. godine debitovao je diplomirani časopis za istraživanje političkih nauka, Beyond Politics.'}"
